    <h2>CSS2 Introduced Media Types</h2>
    <p>
      The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different
      style rules for different media types.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one
      for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices,
      other than the print media type.
    </p>

    <h2>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries</h2>
    <p>
      Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of
      looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
    </p>

    <p>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>width and height of the viewport</li>
      <li>width and height of the device</li>
      <li>orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)</li>
      <li>resolution</li>
    </ul>
